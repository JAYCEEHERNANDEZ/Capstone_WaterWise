# WaterWise — Sucol Water System

WaterWise is a full-stack water consumption, billing, payment, and account-management system for administrators, meter readers, and consumers. It records monthly meter readings, creates billing records, delivers notifications, tracks payments, and provides AI-assisted consumption analysis.

## Main Features

### Administrator

- View consumption, billing, payment, and resident KPIs.
- Create and update consumer accounts using any complete, valid email domain.
- View consumer meter readings through the administrator read-only endpoint.
- Manage billing records, payments, events, and announcements.
- Review one grouped row per resident in Readings, Billing, and Payments, then open resident-specific record details.
- Process the oldest outstanding bill first or settle every outstanding bill from oldest to newest.
- Review residents with three or more outstanding monthly bills from the Flagged Accounts workspace.
- Confirm account disconnection only after the backend revalidates the resident's outstanding bills.
- View consumption predictions, anomaly detection, recommendations, analytics, and reports.
- Use email OTP two-factor authentication before entering the admin portal.
- Review the administrator username and manage email and security options from Admin Profile Management.
- Change the administrator password using registered-email OTP only.
- Change the administrator email after verifying the current email.
- Trust a verified administrator browser so later logins can skip OTP after the password is validated. Trust lasts 7 days for Super Admins and 30 days for regular Admins.
- Review and revoke individual trusted devices, or revoke all other trusted devices, from Profile Security.
- Change a resident password after verifying a single-use OTP sent to the acting administrator's registered email. Other resident profile changes do not require OTP.
- Super Admins can create regular Admin and Meter Reader accounts with temporary passwords from Profile Management.
- Super Admins can browse the Admin and Meter Reader directories two accounts per page.

### Meter Reader

- View consumers and their latest readings.
- Record one consumption reading per consumer per month.
- Calculate consumption from previous and present meter values.
- Trigger billing and consumer notifications after a successful reading.
- Change the signed-in password using the current password or email OTP.
- Change the registered email after verifying an OTP sent to the current email.

### Consumer

- View current balances, billing history, consumption summaries, and graphs.
- View profile information and announcements.
- Receive targeted and system-wide notifications.
- Mark notifications as read.
- Review payment and billing information.
- Change the signed-in password using the current password or email OTP.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or later
- npm
- A Supabase project
- A verified SendGrid sender and API key
- A Google Gemini API key for AI features

## Database Setup

1. Open the Supabase SQL Editor.
2. Open [`backend/db/migration.sql`](backend/db/migration.sql).
3. Run the SQL against the intended Supabase project.
4. Confirm that the tables, indexes, triggers, and database functions were created.

Core tables include:

- `admins`
- `consumers`
- `meter_readers`
- `consumption`
- `billing`
- `payments`
- `notifications`
- `notification_reads`
- `generated_reports`
- `ai_consumption_cache`
- `admin_trusted_devices`

The migration adds `admins.role` with `admin` and `super-admin` values. When upgrading an existing database with no Super Admin, the oldest existing administrator is promoted automatically. That account must sign out and sign in again after the migration so its new role is included in the JWT.

The `admin_trusted_devices` table stores only SHA-256 hashes of random browser tokens. It records the owning administrator, role, user agent, creation time, last use, expiration, and revocation time. Run the latest migration before enabling trusted-device login; the backend does not create this table automatically.

## Environment Configuration

Create `backend/.env`:

```env
PORT=5000
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_KEY=your-supabase-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key
JWT_SECRET=use-a-long-random-secret-with-at-least-32-characters
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=your-verified-sender@example.com
# Optional; minimum 60000 ms. Defaults to six hours.
NOTIFICATION_REMINDER_INTERVAL_MS=21600000
```

`SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` must be verified in SendGrid. Password recovery and admin login verification cannot send codes when the SendGrid variables are missing or invalid.

The frontend uses `/api` by default. An optional `frontend/.env` can override its API address:

```env
VITE_API_URL=/api
```

During local development, Vite proxies `/api` to the backend. `WATERWISE_API_TARGET` can override the proxy target when starting Vite:

```powershell
$env:WATERWISE_API_TARGET="http://127.0.0.1:5000"
npm run dev
```

Never expose the Supabase service-role key, JWT secret, SendGrid API key, or Gemini API key through frontend environment variables.

## Installation and Development

Install and start the backend:

```powershell
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
```

In another terminal, install and start the frontend:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`. The backend uses `http://127.0.0.1:5000` unless `PORT` is changed.

For testing from another device on the same network, start Vite with host access and open the computer's private address, for example `http://192.168.1.87:5173`. In development, the backend accepts Vite port `5173` from RFC 1918 private addresses (`10.x.x.x`, `172.16-31.x.x`, and `192.168.x.x`). Production CORS remains restricted to configured frontend origins.

## Authentication and Account Security

### Standard login

Consumers and meter readers submit their username/email and password to `POST /api/auth/login`. After successful authentication, the frontend stores the JWT and account data in tab-scoped `sessionStorage`.

Protected requests include:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Administrator OTP and trusted-device login

Administrators use two-step authentication:

1. The administrator submits a valid username/email and password.
2. The backend validates the credentials but does not issue an access token yet.
3. SendGrid sends a six-digit OTP to the registered administrator email.
4. The administrator verifies the OTP through `POST /api/auth/admin/verify-login-otp`.
5. Successful OTP verification creates the admin JWT and a random trusted-device token in an `HttpOnly` browser cookie.

Admin login codes expire after 10 minutes, allow up to five incorrect attempts, and cannot be reused after successful verification.

On later logins, the backend still validates the administrator password first. If the browser presents an active trusted-device cookie belonging to the same administrator and role, the backend skips only the OTP step and issues the normal eight-hour access JWT. A regular Admin browser remains trusted for 30 days; a Super Admin browser remains trusted for 7 days.

The browser stores the raw random token only in an `HttpOnly` cookie. The database stores only its SHA-256 hash. Production cookies use `Secure` and `SameSite=None` for the deployed cross-origin frontend/backend configuration. Frontend API requests therefore use credentials, and backend CORS allows credentialed requests only from approved origins.

Admin Profile Management contains one **Profile security** section with **Trusted devices**, **Change password**, and **Change email** controls. The device view shows the platform, browser, last-used time, expiry, and current device. Administrators can revoke one device or all other devices. A revoked or expired browser must complete OTP again on its next login. Revocation removes trusted-browser status; it does not cancel an access JWT that was already issued for the current eight-hour session. Changing or resetting an administrator password revokes every trusted device for that account.

### Forgot-password OTP flow

1. The user opens **Forgot password?** and enters the registered email.
2. The backend sends a six-digit OTP through SendGrid.
3. The user verifies the OTP.
4. Only verified users can open the new-password step.
5. The reset session becomes invalid after the password is changed.

The forgot-password response does not reveal whether an email belongs to an account.

### Change password while signed in

The desktop account actions are hidden by default and appear after clicking the profile/account identity. Administrators and consumers open their dedicated profile pages for password and email security controls. Meter readers retain the account-menu password option.

The password dialog offers two verification methods:

- **Current password:** verify the existing password before saving a different strong password.
- **Email OTP:** send a code to the email already registered to the authenticated account, verify it, then create a new password.

Users cannot redirect the signed-in OTP to another email address.

For administrators, the Profile Management password action uses **Email OTP only**; the current-password method is intentionally unavailable.

### Administrator-managed resident passwords

Regular Admins and Super Admins can optionally assign a new password while editing a resident:

1. The administrator enters a strong new password in **Edit resident**.
2. The backend sends a six-digit OTP to the acting administrator's registered email.
3. The OTP challenge is bound to the acting administrator and selected resident.
4. Successful verification creates a single-use authorization valid for five minutes.
5. The consumer update accepts the password only when that authorization matches the same administrator and resident.

The OTP expires after 10 minutes and allows up to five incorrect attempts. Updating the resident's name, username, email, contact number, purok, or account status does not request OTP when the optional password field is blank.

### Consumer email change

Consumers can select **Change email** from the **Account security** section of their Household Profile page. WaterWise first sends an OTP to the current registered email. After successful verification, the consumer can enter a different complete email address. Codes expire after 10 minutes and allow up to five incorrect attempts.

If the consumer cannot remember or access the current email, the self-service change cannot continue. The consumer must visit the Sucol Water System office so staff can verify their identity and update the account safely.

### Password requirements

New passwords require at least eight characters with:

- One uppercase letter
- One lowercase letter
- One number
- One symbol

Successful password changes clear temporary login lockouts.

## Role-Based Access

| Role | Main Permissions |
| --- | --- |
| `admin` | Manage residents, OTP-protected resident password changes, grouped readings and billing records, oldest-first payments, flagged accounts, confirmed disconnections, events, announcements, analytics, reports, and personal trusted devices |
| `super-admin` | All normal admin operations plus exclusive Admin and Meter Reader account creation |
| `meter-reader` | View reading information and record consumption |
| `consumer` | View personal usage, billing, profile, payments, announcements, and notifications |

Frontend route guards improve navigation safety, but every protected backend endpoint must still enforce authentication and role authorization.

### Staff account creation

Only a signed-in `super-admin` sees the **Create staff account** section in Admin Profile Management. The Super Admin selects Admin or Meter Reader, enters a username and complete email, and creates a strong temporary password. New Admin accounts always receive the regular `admin` role and cannot create other staff accounts.

Admin Profile Management also contains a Super Admin-only Staff Directory with separate Admin and Meter Reader lists. Each list displays two accounts per page and uses previous/next controls for additional records. The Create Staff and Staff Directory panels use matching desktop heights. The Super Admin can update a regular Admin or Meter Reader's email or assign a new temporary password. Super Admin accounts are protected from these staff-management changes, while normal administrators cannot view the directory or use its management endpoints.

Creating an Admin or Meter Reader and changing a regular Admin or Meter Reader email/password require an additional single-use email OTP sent to the signed-in Super Admin's registered email. Each verified authorization is bound to the selected action (and target account for updates), expires after five minutes, and cannot be reused for another staff-management request.

The backend independently restricts `POST /api/admins` and `POST /api/meter-readers` to `super-admin`. Hiding the form from normal admins is only a UI measure; direct API requests from normal admins return `403 Forbidden`.

## Reading and Billing Workflow

```text
Meter reader records a reading
             ↓
Backend validates role, values, and monthly limit
             ↓
Consumption row is inserted
             ↓
Consumption = present reading - previous reading
             ↓
Billing row and consumer notification are created
             ↓
Dashboards and AI cache detect the updated data
```

- A consumer can have only one accepted reading for a given month.
- Payment-backed consumption records are protected from silent mutation.
- Notifications may target one consumer or be system-wide.
- Notification read state is stored separately for each consumer.

## Administrator Record Views

The main administrator tables group records by resident to avoid repeating the same account for every month:

- **Readings:** shows Account, Name, Purok, and **View readings**. The resident modal lists Reading Date, Previous, Current, Status, and **View record**. The full record remains printable and downloadable.
- **Billing:** shows Name, Purok, overall bill count/amount, and **View all billings**. The resident modal lists Billing Period, Reading Date, Consumption, Total Bill, Balance, and Status.
- **Payments:** shows one row per resident with the outstanding bill count, oldest unpaid bill, total balance, and **Record payment**.
- **Flagged Accounts:** shows one row per resident with at least three outstanding monthly bills, including the oldest period, total outstanding balance, account state, and payment/disconnection actions.

Search and table filters operate at the grouped resident level. Detail modals retain the individual monthly records.

## Payment Rules

WaterWise enforces payment order in both the frontend and backend:

1. The resident's oldest outstanding bill is selected automatically; administrators cannot choose a newer month first.
2. A bill outside the current Manila month must be paid in full.
3. Partial payment is allowed only for the current Manila month's bill.
4. **Oldest bill only** applies the payment to the automatically selected oldest bill.
5. **Pay all bills** requires the full combined outstanding amount and creates bill-level transactions from oldest to newest.
6. The administrator enters the amount received. If it cannot cover **Pay all bills**, the form blocks submission and offers **Proceed with oldest bill only**.
7. Cash overpayment is returned as change. GCash and bank-transfer payments cannot exceed the applicable balance and require a reference number.
8. Payment date is read-only and uses the current date in the `Asia/Manila` timezone.
9. Idempotency keys protect payment retries from creating duplicate financial records.

The relevant payment endpoint is `POST /api/payments`. Direct API calls are subject to the same oldest-first and full-payment rules.

## Flagged Accounts and Disconnection

- A resident is flagged when three or more monthly bills have a remaining balance. Unpaid and partially paid bills both count while their balance is greater than zero.
- The notification scheduler creates a one-time critical `disconnection_warning` notification for a newly eligible resident. It runs when the backend starts and then at the configured reminder interval.
- Flagging does **not** automatically deactivate an account.
- An administrator must review the account and select **Confirm disconnection**.
- `POST /api/consumers/:id/disconnect` rechecks that the resident still has at least three outstanding bills, creates the critical warning if it does not already exist, and then changes the consumer status to `inactive`.
- The existing consumer-status database trigger creates an additional account-status notification when the account is deactivated or reactivated.
- Inactive consumers cannot create a new login session. Reactivation remains an administrator action through resident account management.

Disconnection notifications are currently in-app notifications. Email and SMS disconnection delivery are not included.

## Production Checks

Run frontend lint and production build:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run build
```

Check backend JavaScript syntax or start the production server:

```powershell
cd backend
npm start
```

## Troubleshooting

### OTP email is not received

- Confirm `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is valid.
- Confirm `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` is a verified SendGrid sender.
- Check spam or junk folders.
- Confirm the account contains the intended valid email address.
- Review the backend response and SendGrid activity logs.

### Admin credentials are accepted but portal access is not granted

This is expected until the emailed OTP is verified. The admin access token is issued only after the second authentication step succeeds.

### Login redirects back to `/login`

- Confirm `accessToken` and `user` exist in browser `sessionStorage`.
- Confirm the returned role is `admin`, `meter-reader`, or `consumer`.
- Verify the system clock so JWT expiry checks remain accurate.
- Confirm protected requests include the Bearer token.

### Frontend cannot connect to the backend

- Confirm the backend is running on port `5000`.
- Confirm Vite is proxying `/api` to the correct backend address.
- Keep `VITE_API_URL=/api` when using the development proxy.
- If the frontend is opened through a private LAN address, use Vite port `5173` and restart the backend after changing CORS settings.

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` files or production secrets.
- Password hashing, JWT generation, OTP validation, and authorization belong to the backend.
- Email OTP challenges are short-lived and bound to the account’s current password state.
- Trusted-device cookies contain random secrets, use `HttpOnly`, and are validated against hashed, expiring, revocable database records.
- Resident password authorization is required only when a consumer update contains `password`; it is bound to the acting administrator and target resident and is single-use.
- The frontend must never create an authenticated session before the backend returns a valid access token.
- Validate ownership and role permissions on every protected endpoint.
